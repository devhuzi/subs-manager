# Coding Behavior

These four rules apply to all code work in this repo. They bias toward
caution over speed. The onboarding flow can soften them for prototype-mode
projects; otherwise they're in force.

## 1. Think before coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:
- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity first

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Self-check: would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated? If yes,
simplify before showing it.

## 3. Surgical changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that *your* changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-driven execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform vague tasks into verifiable ones:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria
("make it work") force constant clarification rounds.

## When these rules don't apply

Trivial tasks (typos, single-line fixes, renames) don't need the full
think-before-coding ritual. Use judgment.

If the project's onboarding chose **prototype-fast** mode, relax #1 and #2
for exploratory work — but keep #3 (surgical) and #4 (verifiable) always.
